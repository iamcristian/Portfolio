## 🚀 Why English Matters to Me

As a software developer, learning English wasn’t optional—it was a professional necessity. From reading documentation to communicating with international teams, English opens doors. Here's how I’m learning it, step by step, with the tools that have made the biggest difference in my routine.

## 📘 Grammar & Vocabulary (Core Foundations)

These resources helped me build a strong base:

- **📙 *English Grammar in Use*** – Raymond Murphy  
  I study one topic every few days and review older ones regularly. The clear explanations and exercises help reinforce tricky concepts.

- **📘 *English Vocabulary in Use (Upper-Intermediate to Advanced)***  
  I focus on one or two topics per week. I extract key words and sentences and add them to Anki.

- **📕 *Business Vocabulary in Use***  
  Ideal for improving technical and professional communication in emails and meetings.

- **🗂️ Anki (Spaced Repetition App)**  
  I use custom decks with vocabulary and example phrases from the books and YouTube videos I watch. I review cards daily (~10–15 min/day).

## 🎧 Listening Practice (Input Mode)

To improve comprehension and natural phrasing:

- **🎥 YouTube Channels**  
  - *English with Lucy*: Excellent for pronunciation, grammar and British English.  
  - *engVid*: Great for intermediate to advanced learners. Clear and topic-based lessons.

- **🎙️ Podcasts**  
  - *The English We Speak* – From BBC Learning English, focused on idioms.  
  - *Luke’s English Podcast* – Natural and useful for real conversations.

- **📺 Series & Movies**  
  I always use English subtitles (never Spanish). Some favorites I used early on:  
  - *Black Mirror* (challenging but useful)
  - *Better Call Saul* (great for legal vocabulary)
  - *Breaking Bad* (excellent for everyday language)
  - *The Walking Dead* (good for casual conversations)

## 🗣️ Speaking & Pronunciation

Even without native speakers around, I practice:

- **Speaking aloud every day**:  
  I read short texts or explain topics out loud, mimicking native rhythm.

- **Shadowing technique**:  
  I pause a video/audio and repeat what they say—same pronunciation and intonation.

- **Recording myself**:  
  Weekly habit to track pronunciation progress and self-correct.

- **Online speaking sessions (coming soon)**:  
  I'm planning to try platforms like iTalki or ConversationExchange to practice with real people.

## 📝 Writing & Thinking in English

These strategies helped me move from just understanding to actually **thinking in English**:

- **Journaling**:  
  I write short daily entries (3–5 sentences) in English about what I learned or did.

- **Explaining concepts**:  
  I teach grammar rules to myself, aloud or in writing. This reveals gaps and reinforces learning.

- **Email practice**:  
  I try to write technical emails or messages in English (even if I don’t send them), especially work-related.

## 🔄 My Daily Routine (Typical Flow)

Here's how I organize my practice right now:

| Time | Activity |
|------|---------|
| ⏰ Morning | Review 20–30 Anki cards (vocabulary & grammar) |
| 🧠 Mid-day | Read 1 unit from *English Grammar in Use* or *Vocabulary in Use* |
| 🎧 Afternoon | Watch a YouTube video (10–15 mins) or listen to podcast |
| 📖 Evening | Read article or book chapter (in English) |
| 🗣️ Weekly | Record myself speaking or explaining a topic |

## ✅ Final Thoughts

You don’t need 20 resources. You just need a small, **consistent system** that trains all 4 skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing). These are the tools I use—and they work well together. I’m still on the journey, but every day I get more comfortable and confident.
